Here's a complete example of the download clients section in your `config.toml`:

```toml
[torrents]
    # qBittorrent configuration
    [torrents.qbittorrent]
    enabled = true
    host = "http://qbittorrent"
    port = 8080
    username = "admin"
    password = "your_secure_password"

    # Transmission configuration
    [torrents.transmission]
    enabled = false
    username = "admin"
    password = "your_secure_password"
    https_enabled = true
    host = "transmission"
    port = 9091
    path = "/transmission/rpc"

    # SABnzbd configuration
    [torrents.sabnzbd]
    enabled = false
    host = "http://sabnzbd"
    port = 8080
    api_key = "your_sabnzbd_api_key"
```

## Docker Compose Integration

When using Docker Compose, make sure your download clients are accessible from the MediaManager backend:

```yaml
services:
  # MediaManager backend
  backend:
    image: ghcr.io/maxdorninger/mediamanager/backend:latest
    # ... other configuration ...

  # qBittorrent service
  qbittorrent:
    image: lscr.io/linuxserver/qbittorrent:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    environment:
      - WEBUI_PORT=8080
    volumes:
      - ./data/torrents:/downloads
    # ... other configuration ...

  # SABnzbd service
  sabnzbd:
    image: lscr.io/linuxserver/sabnzbd:latest
    ports:
      - "8081:8080"
    volumes:
      - ./data/usenet:/downloads
    # ... other configuration ...
```

<note>
    You should enable only one BitTorrent and only one Usenet Download Client at any time.

<tip>
    Make sure the download directories in your download clients are accessible to MediaManager for proper file management and organization.
